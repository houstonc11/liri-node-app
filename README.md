# liri-node-app

Here is an app that runs with Node. It is used like the iOS app Siri and can deliver information to you from different sources including Twitter, Spotify, and IMDB.

Here are the command options when running liri.js in Node:

1) View a list of my recent tweets:

    "node liri.js my-tweets"
    
2) Find out information about any song using the Spotify API:

    "node liri.js spotify-this-song {enter any song name}"
    
3) Find out information about any movie including IMDB and Rotten Tomato scores:

    "node liri.js movie-this {enter any movie title}"
